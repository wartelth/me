## 🚀 About Me

I'm a spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) engineer working on orbital vehicles and flight software. My background spans NASA JPL, ArianeGroup (Ariane 6), and leading aerospace education institutions (ISAE-SUPAERO, JUNIA ISEN).

**Current focus:** Real-time control algorithms, attitude guidance systems, and high-fidelity 6-DOF simulations for spacecraft operations.

**Side interests:** Building consumer apps, AI-powered tools, and exploring the intersection of aerospace and machine learning.
